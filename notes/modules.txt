Suppose we have two classes in sperate files how to use them in another files

by default the classes are private so we need to export them for letting them another class
to use it

person.js --> file
export class Person {
	walk() {
		console.log('The person is walking');
	}
}



teacher.js --> file

import {Person} from './person';
export class Teacher extends Person {
	teach() {
		console.log('The teacher is teaching to the students');
	}
}

index.js 

import {Teacher} from './teacher';

const teacher = new Teacher();
teacher.walk();
teacher.teach();
